			"lyrics": "I see you dancing on the killing floor \nI see you’re eyes are lookin’ for more \nWithout a sign you are takin’ my hand \nWithout a word and I understand\n\nIt’s just the way that you take a stand \nTo make it clear who’s in command \nThe story ends without a real beginning \nI hear the bells already ringing \n\nBad love, Bad love, Bad love on the run! \n\nI am trapped inside your dream \nAnd no one will hear my scream \nIt’s getting hot and it’s your turn \nDon’t tell me you gotta’ learn\n\nYou know your moves oh yeah so well \nIt just feels like heaven and hell \nNo better sign of a tragedy\nI know it’s about you and me, baby \n\nBad love, Bad love, Bad love on the run! \n"

			"lyrics": "The nights are cold, I need a place to sleep\nI am searching for some meat\nThe sky is blue, the sun is shining bright\nbut in the woods you won't see the light\n\nEveryday there is a new adventure,\nand I'm trying to survive\nbut sometimes, the rain drives me crazy \nI can't afford getting lazy\n\nFeeding the flame\nNever give up\nFacing the fear\nBetter get out of here\n\nI have to run, ain't got no time to rest\nkeep on burning for my quest\nI can feel the rain coming down\nI hear the thunder in the sky\n\nI can see the river rising high\nI know the end is near\nand now it's time, for me to pack my bags\ntime to leave it all behind\n"

Here and now\nI want you to look at me\nI want you to talk to me \nHey, hey, hey, hey! Here and now\nCome on baby and shake for me \nCome on baby and you’ll see \n\nStop wasting all of your time \nBeing someone you don’t know \nDon’t you see it where you can go \nThe road is waitin’, waitin’ for you \n\nEvery moment is worth the time \nEven if you’re waitin’ in line\nJust remember and you’ll be fine \nCause life is runnin’, here and now! \n"

I am ready for your love \nHungry! And I can never get enough \nHungry! I am ready for your love\nHungry! And I can never get enough \n\nHalfway to nowhere\nI think I lost my mind and I’m goin’ blind \nGoin’ blind\n\nThere’s no angel here to protect me\nI ride on and see the sun coming down \nComin’ down\n\nI won’t stop ’til I reach my goal\nBut the devil reaches out and \ntries to get my soul tonight \n\nHungry! I am ready for your love \nHungry! And I can never get enough \nHungry! I am ready for your love\nHungry! And I can never get enough \n\nHungry, I’m ready, I’m ready\nI am ready for your love!"

(Never stop)\nWhen it’s getting hot (Getting hot)\nDon’t even stop! (Never stop)\nOn your way to the top (On your way to the top)\n\nSometimes it may be hard,\nbut as long as someone’s beside me\nI won’t be walking alone,\nwhen I’m thinking about where I’ll be \n\nWith every new experience\nI learn a lesson in life\nI can’t wait for the moment\nuntil I’ll arrive \n\nNever stop! (Never stop)\nWhen it’s getting hot (Getting hot)\nDon’t even stop! (Never stop)\nOn your way to the top (On your way to the top)\n"
